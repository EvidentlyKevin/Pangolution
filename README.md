WHAT IS THIS???
Can we model evolution? To understand if we can this needs to be broken into smaller questions:

What is fitness, and how does differing enviromental pressures cause a species to evolve?
How is a carrying capacity fundementally represented? Is it constant within errorN

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE???
Always something, among that:

The pangolins are being overly punished for exceeding the carrying capacity.
    - *Only kind of true now*
Genes do not have much effect on the simulation as they should.
The regions are not distinct.
Regions may not have their own resources.

The Pangolins are currently _______ (alive and doing something)
